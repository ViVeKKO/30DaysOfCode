I) How to Measure 45 minutes using two identical wires?

If we light a stick, it takes 60 minutes to burn completely. 
What if we light the stick from both sides? It will take exactly half the original time,
i.e. 30 minutes to burn completely. 

II ) Alok has three daughters. His friend Shyam wants to know the ages of his daughters. Alok gives him first hint.
1) The product of their ages is 72.

Shyam says this is not enough information Alok gives him a second hint.

2) The sum of their ages is equal to my house number.

Shyam goes out and look at the house number and tells “I still do not have enough information to determine the ages”.




Alok admits that Shyam can not guess and gives him the third hint

3) The oldest of the girls likes strawberry ice-cream.

Shyam is able to guess after the third hint. Can you guess what are the ages of three daughters?

 


Answer:
1) Product of ages is 72

Below are all possibilities to get 72 from product of three different ages:

1 * 1 * 72 = 72

1 * 2 * 36 = 72

1 * 3 * 24 = 72

1 * 4 * 18 = 72

1 * 6 * 12 = 72

1 * 8 * 9 = 72

2 * 2 * 18 = 72

2 * 3 * 12 = 72

2 * 4 * 9 = 72

2 * 6 * 6 = 72

3 * 3 * 8 = 72

3 * 4 * 6 = 72




2) Sum of the ages is given

1 + 1 + 72 = 74

1 + 2 + 36 = 39

1 + 3 + 24 = 28

1 + 4 + 18 = 23

1 + 6 + 12 = 19

1 + 8 + 9 = 18

2 + 2 + 18 = 22

2 + 3 + 12 = 17

2 + 4 + 9 = 15

2 + 6 + 6 = 14

3 + 3 + 8 = 14

3 + 4 + 6 = 13

All sums are unique except 14. So the age sum must have been 14, otherwise Shyam would have guessed the ages from hint 2 only.

So we have two possible combination to get sum 14

2 + 6 + 6 = 14

3 + 3 + 8 = 14

3) Alok has an oldest girl (not two!!). So the ages must be 3, 3 and 8.

III)
Two trains are on same track and they are coming toward each other. The speed of the first train is
50 km/h and the speed of the second train is 70 km/h. A bee starts flying between the trains when 
the distance between two trains is 100 km. The bee first flies from first train to second train. 
Once it reaches the second train, it immediately flies back to the first train … and so on until 
trains collide. Calculate the total distance travelled by the bee. Speed of bee is 80 km/h.

Let the first train A move at u km/h.
Let the second train B move at v km/h.
Let the distance between two trains be d km
Let the speed of bee be b km/h
Therefore, the time taken by trains to collide = d/(u+v)
Now putting all the known values into the above equation, we get,

u = 50 km/hr
v = 70 km/hr
d = 100 km
b = 80 km/hr

Therfore, the total distance travelled by bee 
= b*d/(u+v) 
= 80 * 100/(50+70) 
= 66.67 km (approx)

IV)
An employee works for an employer for 7 days. The employer has a gold rod of 7 units. How does the 
employer pay to the employee, so that the number of employee’s units increases by one at the end of each day. 
The employer can make at most 2 cuts in the rod.

Employer can pay for seven days by making 2 cuts in a way that he has 3 rods of size 1, 2 and 4.

1st Day: Employer gives 1 unit cut.

2nd day: Takes back 1 unit cut from employee given on first day and gives 2 unit cut.

3rd Day: Gives 1 unit and then the employer is left with 4 unit rod lengths.

4th Day: Takes back cuts of 1 and 2 units. Gives the cut of 4 units.

5th Day: Gives cut of 1 unit.

6th Day: Takes back cut of 1 unit and gives cut of 2 units.

7th Day: Gives cut of 1 unit.

V)
In a Medical Laboratory, you have 240 Injections, one of which is for Anesthesia for a rat. After injecting, one rat fainted 
exactly in 24 hours. You have 5 rats whom you are willing to sacrifice in order to determine which injections contains the 
Anesthesia. How do you achieve this in 48 hours ?

Let us number the Injections with 5 digit numbers consisting of 0, 1 and 2. Let us number the Rats as 1, 10, 100, 1000, 10000.

Number 0 on a Injections represents the Anesthesia will not be inject to rat.
Number 1 on a Injections represents the Anesthesia will be injected to rat on 1st day.
Number 2 on a Injections represents the Anesthesia will be injected to rat on 2nd day (after 24 hours).

The action corresponding to the digit in the unit place will be executed by rat numbered 1.
The action corresponding to the digit in the tenth place will be executed by rat numbered 10.
The action corresponding to the digit in the 100th place will be executed by rat numbered 100.
The action corresponding to the digit in the 1000th place will be executed by rat numbered 1000.
The action corresponding to the digit in the 10000th place will be executed by rat numbered 10000.

Example: Let us say the Injection is numbered 11201. The Injections is injected on the first day to rat numbered 10000, 1000 and 1.
 It is injected on the second day to rat numbered 100. And it is not injected to rat numbered 10.



So if the rat numbered 10000, 1000 and 1 faints within first 24 hours, rat numbered 100 faints in the next 24 hours and the rat
 numbered 10 does not faint, then the Anesthesia Injection has to be 11201.

This way total number possible is,

= 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 = 3^5 = 243 Injections 
So with the help of 5 rats and within 48 hours we will be able to find a Anesthesia Injection among 243 Injections.
